> A distributed generative music player

## TODO

- voices
- device capabilities to voice configuration
- infinite player ~~~ score generation

- waves
	- on note on
		- volume envelope to ADS
			- adsr
	- on note off
		- volume envelope to R

- non-noise
	- oscillator
	- filter
	- reverb?

- for testing: make a single device run more than 1 instrument

- player -> patterns, add notes, generate events list
- 'requestAuditionFrame'
- play on loop
- instrument cancel events
- instrument noteon -> adjust volume via instrument gain node(?)
- armonic instrument prob triangle osc? _|\_

## make build etc
